<h1 id="mic-frequently-asked-questions">MIC Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: When creating an image, MIC shows “Error &lt;creator&gt;: URLGrabber error: http://www.example.com/latest/repos/oss/ia32/packages/repodata/repomd.xml”. What does it mean?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Your network can have some issues, or your proxy does not work. Try another proxy and check the network status.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: MIC shows “Error &lt;repository&gt;: found 1 resolver problem, abort!” What does it mean?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: This is not an issue with MIC, but with the repository you used. Make sure the packages in the used repository have proper dependencies. Try using the repository under the <code>release</code> folder, instead of the <code>snapshot</code> folder.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: I used <code>-A i586</code> to create an i586 image, but MIC showed “nothing provided ….”. What is wrong?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Use <code>-A i686</code>. i586 is lower than i686, causing many packages to be missing from the installation.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: MIC shows in the log: “file /usr/share/whatever conflicts between attempted installs of packageA and packageB”. What does it mean?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: There are conflicts between some packages in the repository you used, but this is not an issue with MIC. Make sure you are using a proper repository. Try using the repository under the <code>release</code> folder, instead of the <code>snapshot</code> folder.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: MIC shows an error: “Command ‘modprobe’ is not available.” What is wrong?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: In some distributions, when you use sudo, the <code>PATH</code> variable is changed and you lose some important paths. Run <code>export PATH=/sbin:$PATH</code> before running MIC.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: MIC shows an error: “Command ‘modprobe’ is not available in Fedora 17.” What is wrong?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: In Fedora 17, when you use sudo, the <code>PATH</code> variable is changed and you lose some important paths. Run <code>export PATH=/sbin:$PATH</code> before running MIC.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: MIC lost some packages which are specified in <code>--includepkgs</code>/<code>--excludepkgs</code>. What happened?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: If you want to include or exclude some packages in a repository, use the <code>--includepkgs</code>/<code>--excludepkgs</code> option in the proper repository command line. However, you must also list these packages in the <code>%packages</code> section; otherwise, the <code>--includepkgs</code>/<code>--excludepkgs</code> option has no effect.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: How does MIC select packages? And how do I set the priority of a repository?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: In general, MIC selects a higher version if 2 or more are available in all repositories. If the version is the same, a higher release number is preferred.<br />
If you assign a priority to a repository, MIC prefers to select packages from a repository with a higher priority, even if a higher version is available in a repository with a lower priority. The default priority for a repository is 99, the range of repository priorities is 1~99, and the larger number has the lower priority.<br />
To set the priority:</p>
<pre><code>repo --name=base --baseurl=[http://whateverurl](http://whateverurl/) --priority=1
</code></pre>

<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>

<p>MIC has the following known issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>‘zypp’ backend is not supported in Fedora 17</strong></p>

    <p>libsat-solver changed to libsolv in Fedora 17, so the zypp backend cannot work well for some dependency issues. Use ‘yum’ as the backend in the Fedora 17 distribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Unable to install syslinux bootloader</strong></p>

    <p>In some new Linux distributions, the “syslinux” package in their official software repositories is version 4.04. It causes a segfault, which is a fatal bug, and MIC fails with syslinux installation errors. The solution is to install the patched “syslinux” package in Tizen’s tools repositories, until the officially released one has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failed to create btrfs image in OpenSUSE</strong></p>

    <p>When creating a btrfs image in OpenSUSE, it hangs, showing image kernel panic. This issue impacts OpenSUSE distributions, such as 12.1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failed to create an image when password in the repository URL contains “@”</strong></p>

    <p>MIC cannot support passwords that contain the “@” character. This issue is to be fixed soon. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>repo --name=Tizen-base --baseurl=https://username:passwd@example.com/arch/packages/ --save  --ssl_verify=no
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
