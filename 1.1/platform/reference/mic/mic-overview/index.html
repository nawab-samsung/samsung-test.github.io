<p>MIC is an image creator used when creating images for Tizen. With the MIC tool, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Create images</strong> of different types for different verticals, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Live CD images</li>
      <li>Live USB images</li>
      <li>Raw images for KVM</li>
      <li>Loop images for IVI platforms</li>
      <li>fs images for chrooting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Chroot</strong> into an image using MICâ€™s enhanced <code>chroot</code> command.</li>
  <li><strong>Convert an image</strong> to another image format.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very useful function when handling situations sensitive to image format.</p>
