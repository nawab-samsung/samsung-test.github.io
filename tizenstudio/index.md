## Get Started with Tizen

To get started with Tizen development:

- Get access

  You can register for an account at [https://www.tizen.org/user/register](https://www.tizen.org/user/register).

- Study the development workflow

  Tizen developers use the Git and [GBS command-line tools](reference/gbs/gbs-overview.md) for most of their work. Tizen source code is managed by [Gerrit](reference/gerrit-usage.md), a code review system for Git-based projects. Source code cloning, development, and review are done under ACL (Access Control Lists). Make sure you have access rights to them.

Start by reading the [Development Workflow](about/work-flow.md) page.
